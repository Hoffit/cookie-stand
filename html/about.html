      <h5><u>Pat's Story</u>
        <section class="text">
        <p>Pat was raised by bears in the woods of Alaska, near Valdez. Which is where his love of Salmon
        originates. Later, he was rescued by Barry, a retired Swiss mountain rescue dog, who was
        vacationing in Valdez and snapping some wildlife photos, when he noticed that one of these was
        not like the others.</p>
        <p>Barry loved doggie cookies, and one day Pat decided to thank him with a creation he'd always
        made for his bear buddies; <i>The Salmon Cookie</i>.
        </p>
        <p>Sadly, Barry died choking on the bones in the cookie. But nevermind that.</p>
